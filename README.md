# WebVR Remote Control

[View Demo](http://povdocs.github.io/webvr-remote)

This demonstrates an experimental virtual reality interaction using a mobile browser to move around and control objects within a virtual space. Scan (or right-click and copy) the QR code for a link to open in mobile Chrome or Firefox. Rotate the device to point the cursor around, and tap the screen once to grab and manipulate any of the objects. Tap again to release. Touch and drag in any direction to move around the space. You will move in whatever direction you're dragging, taking into account the direction the device is pointing.

Load this site in an experimental WebVR build of either [Firefox](http://mozvr.com) or [Chrome](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/08/20/updated-firefox-vr-builds/). When the Rift is connected, hit the "Enter" key or click the "VR" button to enter full-screen VR mode. Hit "Escape" to exit VR and release the mouse cursor.
